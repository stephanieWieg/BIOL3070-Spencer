# ABSTRACT

Fill in abstract… Write this last, after finishing methods, results, and
discussion. Summarize the overall study question, approach, results, and
conclusion in a short paragraph.

# BACKGROUND

Provide background on the WNV system and why we are studying mosquito
blood meals. Include information on DNA extractions, PCR, sequencing,
and how this relates to identifying hosts. Support your statements with
references.

Example: You might cite Komar et al. (2003) showing viremia duration in
birds, which explains why house finches could act as amplifying hosts.
Connect this to the prediction that locations with more house finch
blood meals should also show higher rates of WNV-positive mosquito
pools.

NOTE: Examples of data you can plot for the background info at

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions

Fill in here… state the main research question (e.g., Which bird species
acts as an amplifying host of WNV in Salt Lake City?)

## Hypothesis

Fill in here… write your hypothesis clearly (e.g., House finches are
acting as important amplifying hosts of WNV in Salt Lake City).

## Prediction

Fill in here… Turn the hypothesis into a testable prediction (e.g.,
Locations with mosquito blood meals from house finches will also have
higher numbers of WNV-positive mosquito pools).

# MOTHODS

Fill in here… Summarize the procedures and analyses you use in this
report. In this section, describe what you did and why. Don’t just
restate the code — explain the logic of each analysis in plain language.
Keep each subsection short (2–4 sentences).

## Fill in 1st analysis e.g. barplots

Fill in here… Explain that you compared the number of mosquito blood
meals from each host species between sites with no WNV-positive pools
and sites with one or more WNV-positive pools. Describe why a barplot
helps visualize this comparison.

``` r
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)
```

``` r
par(op)

## Keep the colors mapping for reuse elsewhere
host_species_colors <- species_colors
```

## Fill in 2nd analysis/plot e.g. generalized linear model

Fill in here… Explain that you tested whether the presence or number of
house finch blood meals predicts whether a site had WNV-positive pools
(binary) or a higher WNV positivity rate (numeric). Mention that this
statistical test lets you formally evaluate the relationship suggested
by the barplots.

``` r
# second-analysis-or-plot, glm with house finch alone against binary +/_
glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)
```
